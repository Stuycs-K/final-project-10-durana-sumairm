## Overview
For our project we have decided to do a Mario Kart themed Pac-Man game. For the most part, the game will resemble normal Pac-Man as we all know it, but it will incorporate elements from Mario Kart. For example, instead of the original Pac-Man as the avatar playing, you will be able to choose from Pac-Man and other characters from the Mario Kart world such as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, etc. Similarly, the ghosts will be replaced with “evil” characters from Mario such as Bowser, Waluigi, Wario, etc. The dots that Pac-Man eats will be replaced with coins. Additionally, we will add an extra feature, which will be the lucky boxes from Mario Kart. These will give you a random power-up that can help you defeat the level. We intend to have a single player mode, which will have 10 levels and follow the basic rules of Pac-Man.
## Instructions
Select a character to start with (Mario is the default character). Choose any of the 10 levels to play. In order to move your character use the arrow keys (up, down, right, left). Your objective is to collect all coins in the maze without being killed by a ghost. You have three lives to complete your goal but once all your lives are lost, it is game over. If you collect all coins, then you win! Throughout the levels you may see powerup boxes. Each powerup is random and is supposed to help you win. The booster will allow you to move faster for a brief period. The god star will allow you to not be able to die from the ghosts in a brief period of time. The ghost will reset all of the ghosts back to spawn. Finally, the blue shell will teleport you to a random space on the map.
