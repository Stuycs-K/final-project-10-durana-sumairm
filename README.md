## Overview
For our project we have decided to do a Mario Kart themed Pac-Man game. For the most part, the game will resemble normal Pac-Man as we all know but it will incorporate elements from Mario Kart. For example, instead of the original Pac-Man as the avatar playing, you will be able to choose from Pac-Man and other characters from the Mario Kart world such as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, etc. Similarly, the ghosts will be replaced with “evil” characters from Mario such as Bowser, Waluigi, Wario, etc. The dots that Pac-Man eats will be replaced with coins. Additionally, we will add an extra feature, which will be the lucky boxes from Mario Kart and these will give you a random power up that can help you defeat the level. We intend to have a single player mode, which will have 10 levels and follow the basic rules of Pac-Man and then a two-player mode, in which one person plays Pac-Man and the other person plays the role of a ghost (or potentially where there are two Pac-Men, alongside the ghosts, and they both need to compete for who can gain the most points until the map is empty).
